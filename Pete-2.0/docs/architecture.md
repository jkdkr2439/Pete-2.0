# Pete 2.0 Architecture Overview

## Overview
Pete 2.0 is a non-linear cognitive framework consisting of three main modules:
- **Void Drift Protocol (VDP)**: Handles non-linear thought drifting based on field resonance.
- **Emotion Core Engine (ECE)**: Evaluates thoughts for viability using emotional thresholds.
- **Genesis Seed (GS)**: Generates autonomous thoughts from internal resonance.

## Module Interactions
- **VDP**: Processes input thoughts and drifts them through resonance fields.
- **ECE**: Evaluates drifted thoughts, categorizing them as sustained, liminal, or collapsed.
- **GS**: Generates new thoughts to fill field gaps, adding metaphors for deeper reflection.

## File Structure
- `src/vdp.py`: Implements the VDP module.
- `src/ece.py`: Implements the ECE module.
- `src/gs.py`: Implements the GS module.
- `src/main.py`: Demo script integrating all modules.
