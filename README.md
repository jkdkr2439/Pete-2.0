# Pete 2.0: A Non-Linear Cognitive Framework

Pete 2.0 is an experimental cognitive framework for simulating non-linear, resonance-based thought formation, as described in the paper "Pete 2.0: A Non-Linear Cognitive Framework for Thought Drift and Ontological Resonance" by Kevin (June 2025). It comprises three modules:
- **Void Drift Protocol (VDP)**: Guides thoughts through field-based resonance.
- **Emotion Core Engine (ECE)**: Evaluates thought viability via emotional thresholds.
- **Genesis Seed (GS)**: Generates autonomous thoughts from internal resonance.

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Pete 2.0 framework, grounded in the author's philosophical system, The Ontology of Being (TOB).
